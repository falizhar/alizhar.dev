## Permissions
This is my personal website build with ReactJS. The design of this website is inspired by [adrianhajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_modern_ui_ux_gpt3).

I'm cool with anyone using the code or parts of the code for their own site, it is open source so people can learn from it and adapt it. However, I would encourage you to modify the theme and components it to make it your own. If you are using the site's design largely unmodified, I'd appreciate being credited.

I do not give permission to present any of my personal information such as work experience, contacts, etc. (this website is being actively used as my personal site).
